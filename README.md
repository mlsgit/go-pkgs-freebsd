# go-pkgs-freebsd

I am interested in using go on FreeBSD-based systems and their specific APIs. This is a loose collection of go packages for FreeBSD APIs. 

Feel free to open a PR for contributing. 

# Working with Firewalls

- https://github.com/go-freebsd/pf wrapper for working with pf (though quite old the last commit, as of Oct, 19th, 2023)

# Working with Jails

- https://github.com/briandowns/jail has a go wrapper for the Jail API.

# General places to look for

- https://github.com/go-freebsd has a number of repos
